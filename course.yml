    Do you want to learn how to program, but don't know where to start?
    We have a workshop just for you!

    Under the guidance of an instructor, you will create a version of the classic video game Snake,
    which you may know from older Nokia phones.
    You will experience writing code firsthand,
    learn basic programming concepts, and see what it's like
    when the computer stops acting funny and starts following your commands.

    (If you think the project is not practical enough, don't despair! Rather than being about the game itself,
    the focus is on basic programming principles that you can use later on,
    for example, when creating web applications, analyzing data, machine learning,
    programming robots, or designing system tools.)

    The workshop is for complete beginners.
    You don't need to know anything about programming, just have a computer and know how to use it
    (e.g. open/save a file, install a program).

    The workshop is in English and free of charge.
    However, capacity is limited and registration through the [EuroPython](https://ep2023.europython.eu/pyladies-workshop) website is required.
